# DelaunayAndVoronoi

This project is a basic c++ implementation of Delaunay triangulation.
The algorithm used is randomized incremental construction based on the algorithm presented on
"Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications" by Marc van Kreveld, Mark de Berg, and Otfried Cheong.

More details on the implementation can be found [here](https://choudrouge4.github.io/pdfs/Implementation_of_Delaunay_Triangulation.pdf).
